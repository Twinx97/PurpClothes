# PurpClothes - Ecommerce (SPA)
Project Link: https://purpclothes.netlify.app/

Ecommerce "Single Page Application" using React.js

The products aren't real, the store is not real, it's made up by me for practicing purposes.
The website is hosted on Netlify and updated through Git/GitHub.

# Project Purpose

## What I'll be using in this project:
React.js
TypeScript
Material UI

Jest

## Imagine this problem
A client needs a ecommerce website to sell their products online. They alos need to be able to add, remove and update their products through a content management system.

I will develop a responsive and functional website, where the client can manage their products through a headless CMS.

# The website needs the following:
    - Navigation - Complete
    - Layout
    - Products - Working on...
    - Headless CMS -  Working on...
    - Stripe for payments
    - Shipping
