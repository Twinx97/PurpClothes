# PurpClothes - Ecommerce (SPA)
Project Link: https://purpclothes.netlify.app/

Single Page Application using React.js to build and tailwind CSS for styling.
The company is made up by me and the products aren't real products.
The website is hosted on Netlify and updated through Git/GitHub.

##  Problem
Client needs a website to sell their clothes online. They also need to be able to change and update their products through a content management system.

## Solution
I will develop a responsive and efficient website, where the customer can manage their products through a headless CMS and I'll develop the design and layout as well.

# Development Progress
    - Navigation (almost complete)
    - Landing Page (Working on)
